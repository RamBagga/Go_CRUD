# ZopSmart_Task

## Problem Statement
I have used a hospital's IPD as an example to perform CRUD operations with the following functionalities:
- Add a record to DB when a patient arrives
- See the list of patients currently in the hospital
- Update the record in DB when a patient is waiting, being treated, 
- Delete the record from DB when a patient leaves the hospital

## Technology Stack:

*Backend*: GoFr<br>
*Database*: Postgres SQL<br>
*Containerization*: Docker
## Testing and Validation:

All API functionalities have been thoroughly tested and validated using Postman. Access the collection for hands-on exploration: [https://lively-comet-136197.postman.co/workspace/New-Team-Workspace~f78202a5-d125-441b-91de-dfcc63352fb9/collection/31394778-7f21f2fd-0a7a-4d6b-a14b-5b978b005e4c?action=share&creator=31394778]
